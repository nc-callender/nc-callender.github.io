## Project 2- Vignette Assignment

## Project

The assignment was to select an API (application programming interface), build functions to pull different types of data from the API, and then do some exploratory data analysis.  I chose to pull data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention relating to Vaccination Coverage anong Adolescents.  

While making this selection, I limitied myself to choices that do not require a key, since the end product is required to be made public.  I selected the dataset because I thought it would be interesting to look at vaccination coverge among adolescents.  As children become older, well-child doctor visits may morph into sports physicals and immunizations not be as closely monitored.  Additionally, there is variation between states as far as which vaccines are required for school, which could lead to some interesting variations.  

Datawise, it was most interesting to see how vaccination coverage for hepatitis A varied in states without vaccination requirements for secondary school.  The data allowed for examination with regard to insurance coverage, ethnicity, povery level, and urbanicity.  The finding that the vaccination rates were loer in the uninsured ws not surprising.  However, I was a bit surprised about the fact that lower vaccination coverage was observed in rural areas.  

As a kid, noone in our community had well-child visits; but one day during the summer, the health department set up a vaccination clinic in a local church and all the kids got their shots at the same time.  I find myself picturing events like this and wondering: 

- if they still happen, and   
- if so do they give all the recommended vaccines  
- or just the ones required for public school attendance
